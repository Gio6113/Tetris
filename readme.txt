Tetris is a classic video game created in the mid-eighties. The goal of the game is to reach highscores by rotating and
positioning falling blocks into rows. When a full horizontal row is achieved,
the row is cleared and the blocks/squares above fall, clearing space and awarding points. The game ends when the blocks reach
and exceed a maximum height which occurs when too many blocks/squares stack up and too few rows are cleared.

In my version of tetris, you will be playing on a 20 by 12 grid with over 20 new unique blocks and with increasing speeds starting
when you clear 50 lines.

This Tetris is coded in pygame.
To try the game, install the pygame package, clone the repo, and run the tetris.py file
