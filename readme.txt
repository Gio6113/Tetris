Tetris is a classic video game created in the mid-eighties. The goal of the game is to reach highscores by rotating and
positioning falling blocks into rows. When a full horizontal row is achieved,
the row is cleared and the blocks/squares above fall, clearing space and awarding points. The game ends when the blocks reach
and exceed a maximum height which occurs when too many blocks/squares stack up and too few rows are cleared.

In my version of tetris, I tried including rows of 12 instead of 10, multiple difficulties that would simply increase
the speed of the tetronimos fall as well as a unique diversity of blocks. This Tetris is coded in pygame.
